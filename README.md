# Personal Website
I'm Dylan Sheehan, Bates 2026, This is the code base for my website. I will mostly be using this to practice using git for version control, aswell as showing off the inclass notes I'm able to take using vim and LaTeX. 
I will also be storing homeworks, projects, and assignments here. So feel free to look around. Remember the website is accessible at

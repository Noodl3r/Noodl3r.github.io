        <h2>
          Hello! I'm Dylan Sheehan, a 2nd year student attending Bates College
          in Lewiston Maine
        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently a triple major in Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering at
          Bates on track to graduate in three years. This abnormal academic
          track has been led by a history of insatiable love for learning and
          experimentation. I've never been driven by grades, money, or anything
          material, rather I believe it the ultimate disservice to ones self to
          pass up the opportunity to learn as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no formal background in computer science or programming,
          having just taken an intro java course in high school. Also since my
          college doesn't have a computer science department this likely won't
          change anytime soon. However I love learning new things and teaching
          myself using YouTube so this website exits as a big log of the things
          I'm working on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for checking my site out, Feel free to contact me and I'd love
          to answer any questions about anything!
        </p>

        <p>
          A program designed to select the best 20 students from the 450 person
          freshman class, 30 are selected as nominees. Selection is determined
          more holistically than just pure grades or academic performance. I was
          selected due to my tendency to lead in a classroom setting as well as
          my experience in research labs.
        </p>
        <h3>STEM Scholar</h3>
        <p>
          An admit by essay program where people flagged as potential STEM
          students are selected to be mentored and receive grants for Bates
          research. This grant funded my first year of research during my
          freshman Summer
        </p>
        <h3>Pell Grant Scholarship</h3>
        <p>
          My ability to go to college was heavily influenced by the pell grant
          scholarship program as well as need based financial aid given by Bates
          College. I am incredibly grateful for these funds, and I will be
          looking forwards to taking advantage of the opportunities given to me.

          State Meet Record in the Hammer. I won a few awards :

        <p>
          Through highschool I passed 18 AP exams with 14 5's and 4 4's. The
          majority of these tests were taken as self studies due to my highschool not having many courses.  This pursuit was heavily complemented
          with my experience in both Science Olympiads as well as Chemistry and
          Physics national Olympiads.

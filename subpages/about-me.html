            <h2>Hello! I'm Dylan Sheehan, a 2nd year student attending Bates College in Lewiston Maine, </h2>
            <p> I'm currently a triple major in Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering at Bates on track to graduate in three years. This abnormal academic track has been led by a history of insatiable love for learning and experimentation. I've never been driven by grades, money, or anything material, rather I believe it the ultimate disservice to ones self to pass up the opportunity to learn as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Throughout my life I always struggled with terrible handwriting due to a nerve impingement in my dominant arm. As such, during my freshman year of college I decided that if I was going to start taking notes during my courses I would need an alternative method of working.</p>
            <p>So after doing some searching for a solution to my predicament I found some very interesting blogs and youtube videos, namely <a href=https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1>Gilles Castel's Blog </a> (Rest in Peace ✝) and some helpful <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOtM1mrWjUo&t=1044s> youtube videos</a> introducing me to \(LaTeX\).This proved to be a massive turning point for me. By using Ultisnips and Vim I could quickly take course notes in beautiful formats at speeds comparable to hand writing. </p>
            <p>
            However, I chose to wait for full adaptation of this set up as I was not sure if it would be sustainable in a college setting. So I instead chose to use Obsidian, a proprietary markdown viewer with MathJax support. After a full year of exclusively using this method, I've made the full switch to Vim and \(LaTeX\). I look to create a guide or two on how I did this, as my ultimate work flow is slightly different than those mentioned earlier. But those will come later on.   </p>
            <h2>Awards</h2>
            <h1>Bates College </h1>
            <h3>Dana Scholar Nominee</h3>
            <p> A program designed to select the best 20 students from the 450 person freshman class, 30 are selected as nominees. Selection is determined more holistically than just pure grades or academic performance. I was selected due to my tendency to lead in a classroom setting as well as my experience in research labs.  </p>
            <h3>STEM Scholar</h3>
            <p>An admit by essay program where people flagged as potential STEM students are selected to be mentored and receive grants for Bates research. This grant funded my first year of research during my freshman Summer </p></p>
            <h1>High School</h1>
            <h3>Track and Field</h3>
            <p>Prior to college I was a high level track and field athlete, I have 2 Connecticut state records, one in Class S discus aswell as the overall State Meet Record in the Hammer. I also finished my senior year as the #7 national hammer thrower in the country. But I chose to leave track and field during my freshman year of college to focus on academics. </p>
            <h3>National AP Scholar</h3>
            During Highschool I passed 16 AP exams with 12 5's and 4 4's. The majority of exams were taken as self studies. Due to my high school not having many advanced science or math AP exams, I self studied and got 5's on exams like Calc BC and Physics C Mech and E&M.

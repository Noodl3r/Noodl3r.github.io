        <h2>Second Year, Vim and \(\LaTeX\)</h2>
        <p>
          This second year will likely be my most intense. My third year will be
          marked by the thesis, and my first year was spent throwing a ball back
          and fourth in a pit. This year is entirely devoted to learning as much
          as possible in all of my courses and internship hunting for the
          Summer. Maintaining a high GPA in the face of all the academic
          pressure is also of high importance in order to qualify for the
          Columbia transfer program in computer engineering.

        <h2>First Summer</h2>
        <p>
          My Summer was primarily dominated by the research project, however I
          still found time to work on a lot of math. I was able to learn a lot
          of multivariable calc as well as a ton of proof writing. Below are my
          Khan Academy work on Multi and my independent studying of Proofs by
          Jay Cummings

        <h2>First Year, Obsidian and MathJax</h2>
        <p>
          Being my first year of college I took this year easy academically,
          rather than skipping past all the courses I had AP credit for, I chose
          to retake intro physics and Calc 2 due to having self studied these
          courses in high school. I did however chose to skip the intro gen chem
          sequence as I was not premed and had competed in Chemistry Olympiads
          through high school.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer I also had my first research job. I worked on CUDA
          simulations of Xenon scintillation. It was incredibly interesting and
          fulfilling and motivated my interest in future employment in physics.

          <h1>Statistical Thermodynamics</h1>
          <p>
            Chem302, or statistical thermodynamics was the first real upper
            level course I've taken. It was a great experience to see what upper
            level learning was like as a freshman.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I was expecting more actual chemistry, seeing concepts from
            Multivariable and Dif Eq being used in a chemical context was very
            interesting. Below are 3 of my more interesting homeworks, written
            in markdown and mathjax using vim as a text editor and Obsidian as
            the viewing mechanism.

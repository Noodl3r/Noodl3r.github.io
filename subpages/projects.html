          <p>
            At Bates, I'm most well known for being the guy who takes notes on
            his laptop.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a room filled with iPads and notability tablets, I am simply much
            more comfortable on my Dell Inspirion. This is largely because of x
            software packages,
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li><h2>Vim</h2></li>
            <p>
              Vim is my editor of choice for multiple reasons. However, between
              the blazingly fast run time, low system usage, minimal bloat, and
              amazing configuration options there's simply no other valid
              option.
            </p>
            <li><h2>Live-LaTeX-Preview</h2></li>
            <p>
              This beautiful plugin, located at
              <a href="https://github.com/xuhdev/vim-latex-live-preview"
                >this link</a
              >
              is incredibly useful for giving you the ability to very quickly
              compile and manage your current LaTeX documents in a live preview.
              This proves instrumental while taking in class notes. Solutions
              like VimTex are able to do this aswell, however, they're bloated
              and have many many options. I prefer my LaTeX previewer to only
              help me preview LaTeX, instead of trying to lint my files.
            </p>
            <li><h2>Zathura</h2></li>
            <p>
              Zathura is a well known PDF viewer. It supports vim keybindings,
              works very well with kitty (my terminal) and is incredibly fast. I
              can also configure it with pywal. This simple PDF viewer is
              beautiful, elegant, and fast. There's nothing else to look for.
            </p>
            <li><h2>Ultisnips</h2></li>
            <p>
              Ultisnips is my method of managing snippets across all my
              programming languages. But it's especially helpful when writing
              LaTeX.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Ultisnips, a rather complex equation can be written with very
              few actual keystrokes. Thus making it possible to focus on note
              taking instead of boilerplate. This also proves very helpful while
              writing lab reports, because any time writing "non-content" is
              wasted time.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, in order to display the general equation for internal
              energy one would have to write all of this in LaTeX.
            </p>
            \[ U = \langle E \rangle = k_BT^2 \left( \frac{\partial \ln
            Q}{\partial T} \right) _V = k_BT^2 \frac{1}{Q} \left( \frac{\partial
            Q}{\partial T} \right) _V \]
            <pre>
\[ U = \langle E \rangle = k_BT^2 \left(\frac{\partial \ln Q}{\partial T}\right)_V =
k_BT^2 \frac{1}{Q} \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T}\right)_V \]
            </pre>
            <p>
              This is terrible! What may take someone 15 seconds by hand, would
              take me more than a minute due to all of this boilerplate! But
              with the snippet library that I wrote,This can be done much
              faster.
            </p>
            <pre>
            qoU=rmsE(TAB)= k_BTsrlr(TAB)pa1lnQ(TAB)T(TAB)_V=k_BTsr 1/Q lr(TAB)paQT(TAB)_V
            </pre>
            <p>
              Now while this may not seem too much better, it absolutely is. And
              since you're able to see the text being replaced live with vim,
              it's much more intuitive. This method also has essentially no
              wasted character inputs.
